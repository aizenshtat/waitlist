# An experiment: Citizen developer creating a marketable app using chatGPT

Even though I taught myself to code on an amateur level, I don't have enough skills to code a fully-featured web-app. I have a lot of ideas, but to have an idea and to execute on it is not the same. 

In this experiment I'm going to attempt create a marketaeble app and sell it to at least three real clients by heavily utilising chtGPT. I will post all my prompts and my journey right here in this repository's wiki.

Cheers!
